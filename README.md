# Create-Schedule-with-python
- A small program for creating or modifiying a csv file to import into google calendar.
- It is planned for recurrent events, once a week in my case.
- This is my first contribution, it took me 20 minutes aporx. Yet it is not finished :)
- You can import your csv calendar by going to settings once you're in google calendat. Then, go to Import/Export and import your file.
